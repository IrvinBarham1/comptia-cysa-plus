# CompTIA CySA+ Certification Exam Preparation

These are my own coding and analysis exercises developed to help prepare for the **CompTIA CySA+ (CS0-003)** certification exam.

Each lab is a practical, code-driven exercise that translates CySA+ exam objectives into hands-on cybersecurity workflows.  

This approach reinforces my preparation while demonstrating applied **threat detection, incident response, and vulnerability management** skills.
